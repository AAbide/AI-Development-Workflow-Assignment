### Stages:

- Problem Definition: Define the AI problem and set objectives.

- Data Collection & Preprocessing: Collect and prepare data, ensuring it’s clean and usable.

- Model Development: Train and test models using the preprocessed data.

- Evaluation & Deployment: Evaluate the model’s performance and deploy it into the system.

- Post-Deployment Monitoring & Optimization: Monitor the model’s performance post-deployment and optimize as needed.
